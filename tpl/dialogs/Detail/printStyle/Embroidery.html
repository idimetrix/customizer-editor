                <div>Embroidery is one of the most beautiful and high quality textile decoration methods. We offer
                    embroidery even for a single piece of product. On our webpage are embroidery products marked with a
                    special logo. It is possible to use some of our motives to be embroidered but the best result is
                    achieved by using text, with broad selection of fonts and colors. It is not possible to keep high
                    quality results on too big or very small letters.<br> <br> Text and motives are prepared on
                    computer. Embroidery machine uses more needles to precisely embroider the prepared graphics to the
                    garment.<br> <br> The results are full rich colors thanks to high quality threads. Along with the
                    fabric or garment to be sewn is hooped special material as a backing. This is needed to stabilize
                    the stitches and acquire crispness of the result. Final embroidery is slightly raised above the
                    garment. You can create e.g. original t-shirt or a towel with monogram by using embroidery.
