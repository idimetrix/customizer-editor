                <div>Digital transfer printing is the quickest, cheapest and most simple method for bringing designs
                    with colour gradients onto white or very bright textiles in photo quality.<br> <br> First, the
                    design (e.g. a pixel motif) is printed onto the transfer plastic using a common colour laser
                    printer. It is then pressed onto the T-Shirt at high temperature. Digital transfer is the right
                    printing method for multi-colour designs, pixel motifs and designs with colour gradients.<br> <br>
                    Please note that there is no white colour available in digital transfer printing. This means that
                    digital transfer printing doesn´t make any sense if you want to print onto coloured textiles, as the
                    textile´s colour will shine through. Also, you should know that the colours of your digitally
                    printed shirt will fade out if you wash it frequently. Shirts printed using the digital transfer
                    technique will normally not last longer than 2 years.
