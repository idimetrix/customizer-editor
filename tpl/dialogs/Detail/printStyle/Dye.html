                <div>Sublimation is when a substance transitions between the solid and gas states without going through
                    a liquid stage; the action of dry ice exposed to room temperature is a good example. In a
                    dye-sublimation printer, the printing dye is heated up until in turns into a gas, at which point it
                    diffuses onto the printing media and solidifies.<br> <br> The dye sublimation technique does not
                    only allow you to print designs on textiles, but also enables you to create and print unique cups,
                    mugs, plates and many more products. With the help of a dye sublimation printer, a special ink is
                    brought onto a specially laminated printing paper. This paper is then pressed onto the product und
                    high pressure and at high temperature.<br> <br> Dye sumblimation should be preferred when printing
                    photo-realistic designs or motifs.
