                <div>Flex Printing is also among the best textile printing techniques.<br> <br> Plot printing using Flex
                    foils is the right choice if you would like to print a vector motif with up to a max. 3 colours, and
                    without colour gradients. Flex-printed products guarantees you a high wearing comfort.<br> <br> Flex
                    Printing is done by large colour plotters that mechanically cut your motif or text out of the flex
                    foil. The foil is then pressed onto the products surface under high pressure, and at a high
                    temperature. Finally, the plastic backing is removed and your shirt is ready. Flex-prints have a
                    very plane and slightly shiny surface.
